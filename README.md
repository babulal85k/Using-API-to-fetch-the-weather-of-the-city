Application Programming Interface is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other


To get an API key from OpenWeather, follow these steps:

Sign Up / Log In: If you don't have an account with OpenWeather, go to their website (https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up) and sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, log in using your credentials.

API Keys Section: After signing in, click on your account avatar in the top right corner of the page and select "My API Keys" from the drop-down menu. Alternatively, you can directly access the API Keys page at https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys.

Generate a New API Key: On the API Keys page, you will see a section to generate a new API key. Enter a name for your API key (for identification purposes) and click the "Generate" button.

Access Your API Key: Once the API key is generated, you will see it displayed on the page. It will be a long alphanumeric string, something like d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e.

Copy Your API Key: Click the copy icon next to the API key to copy it to your clipboard. Make sure to keep it secure and do not share it publicly.

That's it!

Remember to keep your API key safe and don't share it in public repositories or any other public places to avoid unauthorized access to your account and usage limitations from OpenWeather.
